# frontend
codebase for the app frontend

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install and how to install them.

* Install Flutter SDK. For installation instructions, see [Flutter install guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
* Dart SDK comes with Flutter. So, if you've installed Flutter correctly, you should have Dart as well.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/SwitchSkills/frontend.git
```

Navigate into the cloned directory.

```
cd switchskilss
```

Get all the dependencies.

```
flutter pub get
```

### Running the App

You can run the app using an emulator or on your physical device.

1. To check that everything is set up correctly, run the following command:

    ```
    flutter doctor
    ```

    This will show any dependencies you still need to install.

2. To run the app on an emulator:

    Start your emulator.
    
    Run the following command in the terminal:

    ```
    flutter run
    ```
