A short description of the app goes here.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install and how to install them.

* Install Flutter SDK. For installation instructions, see [Flutter install guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
* Install Android Studio and/or VS Code. Android Studio is used for running the emulator, and VS Code is used for code editing.
* Dart SDK comes with Flutter. So, if you've installed Flutter correctly, you should have Dart as well.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone <url_of_this_repository>
```

Navigate into the cloned directory.

```
cd <name_of_repository>
```

Get all the dependencies.

```
flutter pub get
```

### Running the App

You can run the app using an emulator or on your physical device.

1. To check that everything is set up correctly, run the following command:

    ```
    flutter doctor
    ```

    This will show any dependencies you still need to install.

2. To run the app on an emulator:

    Start your emulator.
    
    Run the following command in the terminal:

    ```
    flutter run
    ```
    
3. To run the app on your physical device:

    Connect your device to your computer.
    
    Run the following command in the terminal:

    ```
    flutter run
    ```
